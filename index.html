        Introduction
        ============
        
        The Government Data Architecture Community (GDAC) is a cross-government collaborative network and related sub-groups (smaller communities of practice) that brings together anyone who works in or around the field of data architecture in local, regional, devolved and central government. We discuss good practice, challenges that we currently face and work together as data architects towards better data-sharing and interoperability throughout government.
        
        GDAC currently has four sub-groups which operate as smaller communities of practice collaborating around specific challenges to data-sharing and interoperability across government:
        
        - Business glossaries
        - Metadata
        - Data standards
        - Data modelling
        
        The GDAC Business Glossary Sub-group aims to establish a common understanding of terms used by the community of data management professionals. This document is not intended to be an official, authoritative nor complete set of terms and their associated definitions, but rather a shared asset to encourage contributions, discussion, debate and engagement from the wider community.
        
        The vocabulary is available as a [Turtle file](https://github.com/rossbowen/glossary/blob/gh-pages/terms.ttl) from the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rossbowen/glossary). For additional details on how this documentation was created and is maintained, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rossbowen/glossary/tree/gh-pages/src).
        
        Contributing
        ============
        [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rossbowen/glossary/issues) are preferred for discussion of terms.

Providing visibility of concepts with an associative relationship can:
•	assist users in gaining a broader understanding of a topic
•	provide clarification between concepts with overlapping meanings that may be confused by users but are intended to be used as separate concepts
•	provide clarity where a concept is a necessary component in any explanation or definition of another.

Associated relationships may exist between terms in the same hierarchy or different hierarchies.

A vocabulary may list and define the types of associative relationships used. The types of relationship will vary from vocabulary to vocabulary, for example, the types of associative relationships between generic terms would differ to the types of associative relationships between people. 

Types of associative relationships found between terms include:
•	related to
•	formerly related to 
•	distinguished from
•	meaning/usage overlaps with
•	possible identified as

Types of associative relationships found between people include:
•	student of
•	teacher of
•	uncle of<span></td>

•	perform data preparation and analysis efficiently and with confidence.

A data catalogue may provide other capabilities including:
•	support for data curation and collaborative data management 
•	data usage tracking
•	intelligent dataset recommendations 
•	enforcing policy and data governance.

Data catalogues should not exist in isolation but should share metadata bidirectionally with other data management and analysis tools and data platforms. 
Modern machine learning-augmented data catalogues may automate various tasks involved in data cataloguing, including metadata discovery, ingestion, translation, enrichment and the creation of semantic relations between metadata. <span></td>

A data dictionary may describe data in business terms, however, the information held within a data  dictionary extends to include the ‘technology relevant’ or ‘machine readable’ articulation of data. 

A data dictionary will include information on data types, detail of structure and security relationships. It can be used to manage the names, descriptions, structure, characteristics, storage requirements, default values, relationships, uniqueness, and other attributes of every data element in a data model.
The data dictionary bridges the gap between the content as its defined and how that content is articulated in a physical implementation. A data user for example, may consult a data dictionary if they wanted to know if ‘Customer ID’ is a character field or numerical field. 
The content of a data dictionary is usually extracted from the database or modelling tool and is sometimes seen as a data model in a narrative form<span></td>

Individual categories within the hierarchy are arranged in order of importance or status. Moving up the hierarchy means expanding, or broadening, the category. Moving down the hierarchy means refining, or narrowing, the category.

Not all hierarchies are simple, one-to-one-or-many parent-child relationships. Some hierarchies contain categories that can be in multiple parent categories. Taxonomies that allow this cross-listing are known as polyhierarchical.<span></td>

A Taxonomy helps to reduce ambiguity and control synonyms. It is a system for naming and organising things into groups, that share similar characteristics, to make them easier to index and then to find.

Depending upon the principles or rules of the Taxonomy, objects would normally be related to one and only one category. However, according to the purpose of the Taxonomy, there may be circumstances where objects could be related to more than one category.

For example, it can be used to organise knowledge (content, documents, records, etc) by using the controlled vocabulary to make it easier to find related information.

There are several recognised types of Taxonomy.<span></td>
