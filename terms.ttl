A Taxonomy helps to reduce ambiguity and control synonyms. It is a system for naming and organising things into groups, that share similar characteristics, to make them easier to index and then to find.

Depending upon the principles or rules of the Taxonomy, objects would normally be related to one and only one category. However, according to the purpose of the Taxonomy, there may be circumstances where objects could be related to more than one category.

For example, it can be used to organise knowledge (content, documents, records, etc) by using the controlled vocabulary to make it easier to find related information.

There are several recognised types of Taxonomy."""@en;

A data dictionary may describe data in business terms, however, the information held within a data  dictionary extends to include the ‘technology relevant’ or ‘machine readable’ articulation of data.

It can be used to manage the names, descriptions, structure, characteristics, storage requirements, default values, relationships, uniqueness, and other attributes of every data element in a data model.
The data dictionary bridges the gap between the content as its defined and how that content is articulated in a physical implementation. A data user for example, may consult a data dictionary if they wanted to know if ‘Customer ID’ is a character field or numerical field.
